## Overview

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language used to format plain text documents.
It is designed to be easy to read and write.
It still allows for rich text formatting such as **bold**, _italics*, lists, links, and more.

## Basic Syntax

Some of the basic Markdown syntax is shown in the table below.

| Elements | Syntax | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Heading | `# H1`, `## H2` | ## Section Title |
| Bold | `**text**` | **bold** |
| Italic | `*text*` | _italic_ |

See the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet
"Markdown Cheat Sheet") for the complete list.
