# Getting Started with Markdown for Technical Writers

Markdown is a markup language that allows technical writers and developers to collaborate on files, develop documentation, and coordinate changes in the same environment while using the same tools. It is relatively simple to learn and can help streamline the product development process for your teams.

## Advantages

* Markdown is formatted in readable plain text, so content can be copied and pasted to other files without having to worry about any embedded styles.
* Files are relatively small and easily portable, without heavy graphics or other content that can make file sizes overly large.
* Many different programs use Markdown, in particular Git and GitHub, so content is easy to share and transfer to other platforms.

### Examples

| Markdown        | Results           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| "*" symbol before and after text|*This text is italic*|
| "**" symbol before and after text|**This text is bold**|
|"#." plus space|1. This text is a numbered list|

## Limitations

* Markdown has rudimentary styling options and does not support different colors, fonts, or graphics of any kind (but you can always link out to an image).
* Tables are a convenient way to organize content, but nesting different styles within tables may not always show the desired result in Markdown.
* While Markdown functions similarly across multiple platforms, each program may interpret inputs a bit differently.

## Advice for Technical Writers

* Use references such as this [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#tables) to quickly copy and paste common Markdown patterns.
* Practice, practice, practice in your own environment until you can comfortably adopt Markdown into your workflow.
* When swapping between different platforms, always make sure to preview your output before publishing, ensuring it has rendered correctly and according to your team's standards.
