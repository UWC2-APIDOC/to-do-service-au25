For **bold text**, surround your text with two asterisks on each side.

For _italics_, surround your text with underscores on each side.

You can even combine both bold and italics, to make your text **_really_** stand out!

For ordered lists:

1. Type a number and a period.
2. Continue your ordered list!

For unordered lists:

- Type a dash.
- Continue your unordered list!

For tables, surround your cell content with pipes. To separate headers from body rows, use dashes as the cell content:

| Easy-to-read, plain-text format is straightforward to learn | Lacks tools for x-refs/indexes/TOCs for large, complex docs |
| Styled text doesn't need embedded, complex formatting tags  | Less advanced features, e.g. semantic tags for localization |

You can even insert an image:
