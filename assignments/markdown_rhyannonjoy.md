# Markdown guide: pros, cons, and tips

## Advantages :sparkles:

1. **Easy to Read**: uses plain text, so you can focus on what you write, not on tricky formatting.
2. **Works Everywhere**: many apps and sites use Markdown, so you can use it in lots of places.
3. **Tracks Changes**: with tools like Git, you can see what changed and work with others easily.

## Limitations :triangular_flag_on_post:

1. **Not Always the Same**: Markdown can look different in each app or website.
2. **Few Style Choices**: you don't have control over the design layout.
3. **Different Versions**: some tools add new features, but they might not work everywhere.

## Advice :writing_hand:

1. **Try It Out**: make a new Markdown file like _*my_notes.md*_.
Use the preview in your editor to see how it looks.
2. **Use a Cheat Sheet**: see the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)
for quick help.
3. **Learn More**: read about [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
and [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/).
