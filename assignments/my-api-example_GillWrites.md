# Getting Started with Markdown


## What is Markdown?

Markdown, a lightweight markup language, is a text-based notation. A text-based notation is a simple system that involves writing in a standard text editor and using characters to represent formatting. For example, in Markdown:
- #symbol makes a heading
- *symbol before and after a word creates italics (e.g. *test*)
- **symbol before and after a word creates bold (e.g. **test**).

Markdown is used to format plain text that can coverted into styled documents, like HTML.<br><br>
