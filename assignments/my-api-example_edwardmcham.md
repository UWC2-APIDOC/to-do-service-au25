* Easy to **type**.

* Easily **rendered into  HTML**.
* Basic numbering system, but works well just by preceding each item with `1.`
* Comes in **multiple flavors**, each supporting various features not supported in basic Markdown.
* Basic Markdown allows **HTML tags**.

## Cons

* No one official standard flavor.
* Not all browsers and viewers support all Markdown flavors.
