# Markdown Quickstart: Advantages, Limitations and Advice :sunglasses:

## Advantages :sparkles:

1. **Readability**: uses plain text language and minimal structure, allowing you to focus on the content itself rather than complex formatting syntax.
2. **Wide Adoption**: supported across many platforms, making it a valuable skill that can be applied in many contents.
3. **Version Control**: while using Markdown with systems like Git, changes are easy to track, simplifying collaboration, reviews, and edit records.

## Limitations :triangular_flag_on_post:

1. **Not Standardized**: you never know how it will be rendered in a browser
2. **Stylistically Limited**: the ways in which you can disaply your content are confined
3. **Incompatiblity**: many versions exist in which people have extended Mardown's functionality, which cannot guarantee compatibility with other tools

## Advice :writing_hand:

1. **Experiment**: create a new Markdown file in this format *<your_file_name.md>*. Use the preview feature in your text editor to practice formatting and develop a preference. 
2. **Cheat Sheet**: check out [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to reference John Gruber's original design document.
3. **More Information**: refer to [Basic Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) and [Extended Syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)
