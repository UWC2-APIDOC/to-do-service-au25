## Tutorials

### Before you start

Please ensure that you've completed the [installation](../before-you-start-a-tutorial.md) instructions on the development system you'll use for the tutorial.

### Enroll a new user

Enrolling a new user in the service requires that you use the `POST` method to store the details of a new [`user`](../api/user.md) resource in the service.

To enroll a new user:

1. Make sure your local service is running, or start it by using this command, if it's not.

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
    json-server -w to-do-db-source.json
    ```

2. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
3. In the Postman app, create a new request with these values:
    * **METHOD**: POST
    * **URL**: `{{base_url}}/users`
    * **Headers**:
        * `Content-Type: application/json`
    * **Request body**:
        You can change the values of each property as you'd like.

        ```js
        {
            "lastName": "Jones",
            "firstName": "Jenny",
            "email": "jen.jones@example.com"
        }
        ```

4. In the Postman app, choose **Send** to make the request.
5. Watch for the response body, which should look something like this. Note that the names should be the same as you used in your **Request body** and the response should include the new user's `id`.

    ```js
    {
        "lastName": "Jones",
        "firstName": "Jenny",
        "email": "jen.jones@example.com",
        "id": 5
    }
    ```

## Add a new task

Adding a new task to the service requires that you use the `POST` method to store the details of the new [`task`](../api/task.md) resource in the service.

To add a new task:

1. Make sure your local service is running, or start it by using this command, if it's not.

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
    json-server -w to-do-db-source.json
    ```

1. Open the Postman app on your desktop.
1. In the Postman app, create a new request with these values:
    * **METHOD**: POST
    * **URL**: `{{base_url}}/tasks`
    * **Headers**:
        * `Content-Type: application/json`
    * **Request body**:
        You can change the values of each property as you'd like.

        ```js
        {
            "userId": 3,
            "title": "Get new tires",
            "description": "Get new tires for Hoppity",
            "due_date": "2025-03-11T14:00",
            "warning": "60"
        }
        ```

1. In the Postman app, choose **Send** to make the request.
1. Watch for the response body, which should look something like this. Note that the names should be the same as you used in your **Request body** and the response should include the new user's `id`.
