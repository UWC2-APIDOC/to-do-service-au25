## How Do I Learn More?
You can use the To-Do Service API reference documentation for detailed descriptions of the service's resources.

The API reference docs refer to a `{base_url}` when they refer to the URL of a resource. The `{base_url}` value depends on the installation of the service.

When run locally for testing, the `{base_url}` is generally `http://localhost:3000`.
