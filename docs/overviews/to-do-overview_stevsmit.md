# To-Do Service API Overview

> **A service that you can rely on!**

The **To-Do Service** provides a rest API that that offers users the ability to post tasks and receive reminders for those tasks. Whether you are a new developer integrating a task-management feature or an experience user managing your own to-do list, the **To-Do Service** API offers an accessible interface for creating and managing user accounts and tasks.

## Why Use the To-Do Service API?

The **To-Do Service** API is centered around two resources:

1. **User Management**: With this resource, you can easily enroll new users and managing existing accounts. You can also retrieve user details by ID or view all registered users.

2. **Task Management**: With this resource, you can create new to-do items and set up reminders.

Collectively, these resources allow you to manage time and tasks for yourself or others.
