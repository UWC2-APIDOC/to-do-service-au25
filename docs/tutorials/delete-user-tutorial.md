# Tutorial: Delete a User

Learn how to remove a user from the To-Do Service using the DELETE endpoint.

## Before You Begin

Make sure you have:
- The To-Do Service running on `http://localhost:3000`
- A user ID for the user you want to delete
- cURL installed (or use Postman)

**Estimated time:** 5 minutes

## What You'll Learn

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to:
1. Find a user's ID
2. Delete a user using their ID
3. Verify the user was deleted successfully

---

## Step 1: View All Users

First, let's see what users exist in the system.

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/users
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  },
  {
    "id": "2",
    "name": "Bob Smith",
    "email": "bob@example.com"
  }
]
```

**Note the user ID** you want to delete. In this example, we'll delete user with `id: "2"` (Bob Smith).

---

## Step 2: Delete the User

Use the DELETE method with the user's ID in the URL.

**Request:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/users/2
```

**Response:**

If successful, you'll receive a `200 OK` status with an empty response body `{}`.

**What this means:**
- The user has been permanently removed from the database
- All associated data for this user is deleted
- This action cannot be undone

---

## Step 3: Verify the Deletion

Let's confirm the user was deleted by retrieving all users again.

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/users
```

**Response:**
```json
[
  {
    "id": "1",
    "name": "Alice Johnson",
    "email": "alice@example.com"
  }
]
```

**Success!** User ID "2" (Bob Smith) is no longer in the list.

---

## Step 4: Try to Get the Deleted User

What happens if you try to access a deleted user directly?

**Request:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/users/2
```

**Response:**
```json
{}
```

You'll receive an empty object, confirming the user doesn't exist.

## Common Issues

### Problem: "404 Not Found"
**Cause:** The user ID doesn't exist.

**Solution:** 
- Verify the user ID is correct
- Check that the user hasn't already been deleted
- List all users to see available IDs

### Problem: "Cannot DELETE"
**Cause:** The endpoint URL is incorrect.

**Solution:**
- Verify the URL format: `http://localhost:3000/users/{userId}`
- Make sure you're using `-X DELETE` flag
- Check that json-server is running

---

## Best Practices

✅ **Always verify the user ID before deleting**
- List all users first to confirm the ID exists

✅ **Be cautious with delete operations**
- Deletion is permanent and cannot be undone
- Consider keeping records of deleted users if needed

✅ **Check for dependencies**
- Verify if the user has associated tasks or data
- Clean up related data if necessary
