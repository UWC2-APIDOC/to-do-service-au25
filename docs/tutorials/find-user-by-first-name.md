# Tutorial: Find a user by first name

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to use the `firstName` query parameter to filter users by their first name.

Expect this tutorial to take about 10 minutes to complete.

## Before you start

Make sure you've completed the [Before you start a tutorial](../before-you-start-a-tutorial.md) topic on the development system you'll use for the tutorial.

## Find a user by first name

Locating a user by `firstName` requires using the `GET` method to retrieve the details of the [`user`](../api/user.md) resource in the service.

To find users with a specific first name, add the `firstName` query parameter to the `user` endpoint. This example uses the name Jill.

1. Make sure your local service is running, or start it by using this command in the terminal, if it's not.

    ```shell
    cd <your-github-workspace>/to-do-service/api
    json-server -w to-do-db-source.json
    ```

2. Open Postman and create a new request:
   1. Click **New** > **HTTP** or the **+** icon in the header.
   2. Set the request method to **GET** using the corresponding dropdown menu.
   3. In the request URL field, enter:

      ```shell
      http://localhost:3000/users
      ```

   4. Click the **Params** tab below the URL field
   5. Add a query parameter:
      - **Key:** `firstName`
      - **Value:** `Jill`

   The query parameter filters the results by appending `?firstName=value` to the URL. Replace `value` with the first name you want to find. Postman automatically formats the URL with your query parameter.

3. Click **Send** to make the request.

4. The system returns only users whose first name exactly matches "Jill." The match is case-sensitive and must be exact. For example, "Jill" won't match "jill."

    ```js
    [
      {
        "lastName": "Jones",
        "firstName": "Jill",
        "email": "j.jones@example.com",
        "id": 2
      }
    ]
    ```

## Verify your results

1. To confirm the filter is working, compare the filtered results to all users in the system:
   1. In the same Postman request, click the **Params** tab.
   2. Uncheck the checkbox next to the `firstName` parameter, or delete it.
   3. Click **Send**.

2. You should see that compared to the general `/users` query, the filtered response returns only users from the full list whose first name matches your `firstName` parameter.
