# Quick Start Get Tasks

## Introduction

This document will help you to understand how to use the GET method to interact with tasks on the To-Do Service API. By reading this Quick Start guide, you should be able to understand and use the GET method for retrieving a list of all tasks and a specific task using the API. The HTTP method "GET" is used in REST APIs to request data from a specified resource. For more details on the GET method, [see this page.](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_httpmethods.asp)

Allow 15 minutes for successfully reading and understanding this document.

Before you start the document, you need a terminal application such as GitBash or PostMan. You also need a current or LTS version of node.js and version 0.17.4 of json-server. For more details, [see this guide.](../before-you-start-a-tutorial.md)

## Retrieve a list of all tasks

### Use cURL (all tasks)

Using the terminal, you should enter the following text:

```shell
http://localhost:3000/tasks/
```

This request uses the GET method to query the tasks resource for a list of all the tasks. You will see a list of all the tasks as a response in your terminal. The result should look something like this:

```json
[
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Grocery shopping",
    "description": "eggs, bacon, gummy bears",
    "dueDate": "2025-09-20T17:00",
    "warning": "10",
    "id": 1
  },
  {
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Piano recital",
    "description": "Daughter's first concert appearance",
    "dueDate": "2025-10-02T15:00",
    "warning": "30",
    "id": 2
  },
  {
    "userId": 2,
    "title": "Oil change",
    "description": "5K auto service",
    "dueDate": "2025-11-10T09:00",
    "warning": "60",
    "id": 3
  },
  {
    "userId": 3,
    "title": "Get shots for dog",
    "description": "Annual vaccinations for poochy",
    "dueDate": "2025-12-11T14:00",
    "warning": "20",
    "id": 4
  }
]
```

If you do not see a response at all, ensure that your local JSON server is running.

### Use PostMan (all tasks)

 Make sure that you select the "GET" method from the drop-down menu in the bar at the top of the screen. Enter the following text.

```shell
http://localhost:3000/tasks
```

This request uses the GET method to query the tasks resource for a list of all the tasks. You will see a list of all the tasks as a response in the "Body" tab at the bottom of PostMan. The result should look something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "userId": 1,
        "title": "Grocery shopping",
        "description": "eggs, bacon, gummy bears",
        "dueDate": "2025-09-20T17:00",
        "warning": "10",
        "id": 1
    },
    {
        "userId": 1,
        "title": "Piano recital",
        "description": "Daughter's first concert appearance",
        "dueDate": "2025-10-02T15:00",
        "warning": "30",
        "id": 2
    },
    {
        "userId": 2,
        "title": "Oil change",
        "description": "5K auto service",
        "dueDate": "2025-11-10T09:00",
        "warning": "60",
        "id": 3
    },
    {
        "userId": 3,
        "title": "Get shots for dog",
        "description": "Annual vaccinations for poochy",
        "dueDate": "2025-12-11T14:00",
        "warning": "20",
        "id": 4
    }
]
```

If you do not see a response at all, ensure that your local JSON server is running.

## Retrieve 1 specific task

### Use cURL (1 task)

Using the terminal, you should enter the following text:

```shell
http://localhost:3000/tasks/1
```

This request uses the GET method to query the task for a specific resource for one matching result. You will see the result response in your terminal. The result should look something like this:

```json
{
  "userId": 1,
  "title": "Grocery shopping",
  "description": "eggs, bacon, gummy bears",
  "dueDate": "2025-09-20T17:00",
  "warning": "10",
  "id": 1
}
```

Change the number in your query to get a different task. If you do not see a response at all, there might not be a task with the number that you enter. If you are unable to retrieve any tasks, ensure that your local JSON server is running.

### Use PostMan (1 task)

 Make sure that you select the "GET" method from the drop-down menu in the bar at the top of the screen. Enter the following text.

```shell
http://localhost:3000/tasks/1
```

This request uses the GET method to query the tasks resource for one specific task. You will see the retrieved result in the "Body" tab at the bottom of PostMan. The result should look something like this:

```json
{
    "userId": 1,
    "title": "Grocery shopping",
    "description": "eggs, bacon, gummy bears",
    "dueDate": "2025-09-20T17:00",
    "warning": "10",
    "id": 1
}
```

Change the number in your query to get a different task. If you do not see a response at all, there might not be a task with the number that you enter. If you are unable to retrieve any tasks, ensure that your local JSON server is running.

## Conclusion

In this guide, you have successfully learned how to use the GET method to query a full list of tasks, as well as a specific task using both cURL and PostMan.
